# Juneyoung Lee (이준영), Ph.D.

I am an Applied Scientist at Automated Reasoning Group in AWS (Austin, TX). I work on writing provably correct code that is also fast.

Previously, I was a research engineer [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/en/home/), a pioneering company for developing homomorphic encryption frameworks.
I also fulfilled my military service in an alternative form by working for this company.

I received Ph.D. from [Software Foundations Lab](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/),
[Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) in August, 2021.
When I was a graduate student, I worked on clarifying the semantics of the intermediate
representation of [the LLVM compiler infrastructure](https://llvm.org) and
implementing compiler optimization validators.

I actively sent patches to LLVM
([commits](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits?author=aqjune)/[patches](https://reviews.llvm.org/differential/query/ZDmAEKkUFLzv/#R))
to (1) make LLVM IR semantics abide by a formal definition, and (2) resolve performance issues of the generated machine code after my patches.
I also participated in developing [Alive2](https://github.com/AliveToolkit/alive2) ([https://alive2.llvm.org/](https://alive2.llvm.org/)), an automatic optimization validator ([pull requests](https://github.com/AliveToolkit/alive2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aaqjune)).
