# Juneyoung Lee (이준영), Ph.D.

I'm a research engineer at [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/eng/),
a pioneering company for developing homomorphic encryption frameworks.

I received Ph.D. from [Software Foundations Lab](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/),
[Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) in August, 2021.
When I was a graduate student, I worked on clarifying the semantics of the intermediate
representation of [the LLVM compiler infrastructure](https://llvm.org) and
implementing compiler optimization validators.
I actively sent patches to LLVM
([commits](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits?author=aqjune)/[patches](https://reviews.llvm.org/differential/query/ZDmAEKkUFLzv/#R))
and participated in developing [Alive2](https://github.com/AliveToolkit/alive2) ([online](https://alive2.llvm.org/)), an automatic optimization validator ([pull requests](https://github.com/AliveToolkit/alive2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aaqjune)).
